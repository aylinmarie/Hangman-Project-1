# Hangman
Hangman Project for WDI9 Project #1

## Overview
Hangman the Mouse! The Hangmouse game displays a secret word as a list of hidden letters (hint: they're cheesy). You will have 6 guesses to figure out the word. Use the alphabet board to guess each letter. If you incorrectly guess a letter, you will lose a guess! If you guess correctly, don't worry you are in the clear. If you guess all of the letters you win!
